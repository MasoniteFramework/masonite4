# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The best approach to reporting a vulnerability with Masonite is to join the [Slack Channel](http://slack.masoniteproject.com) and messaged
Joseph Mancuso and tell him about the issue. He will communicate this to his maintainers and get a patch ready and shipped ASAP.

You may also send an email to joe@masoniteproject.com.

## LTS Versions

LTS versions will receive security fixes for 3 years and bug fixes for 2 years.

If you are a company looking to work on Masonite long term, it is recommended to first look at the latest LTS version before looking at other versions.
Upgrading applications can be costly, and you may decide to stay on the same version of Masonite for extended periods.

It is recommended to stay on the latest version of Masonite to get the most up-to-date features and improvements, but that does
not always align with your business's goals.
